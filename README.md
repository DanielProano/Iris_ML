# Iris Dataset ML Classifier

This project implements a machine learning model to classify iris flowers using the classic [Iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). Itâ€™s a simple yet powerful introduction to the world of machine learning and classification.

## What I Learned

This project was my (like many others!) first real step into the world of Machine Learning.

I followed a tutorial that taught me how to:
- Load and explore the dataset using pandas
- Transfer data to NumPy arrays for numerical analysis
- Use Matplotlib to visualize relationships in the data
- Apply a Logistic Regression algorithm using scikit-learn

From this, I learned:
- The basics of Matplotlib, NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn
- How to set up a DataFrame using pandas
- How to train a model and use it to make predictions
- How classification algorithms group and learn from labeled data
