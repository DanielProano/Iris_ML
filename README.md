This project implements a machine learning model to classify iris flowers based on the classic Iris dataset.


What I learned:
This project was my, like many others, intro to Machine Learning. I 

followed a tutorial that taught me how to setup and load the dataset.

From the project, I learned the basics of MatPlotLib, numpy, pandas,

and Sklearn. I learned how to setup a basic table with pandas, how to 

transfer data to numpy for analyzing, and how to use a Logistic Regression 

algorithm to train a model to make decisions and grouping. 


Features
Loads and preprocesses the Iris dataset

Explores basic data statistics

Trains a classification model using Logistic Regression

Evaluates model performance with accuracy and classification report

Supports prediction on new data points


Getting Started
Clone this repository.

Install dependencies (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib):

Run the code within the "model.py" file. This will look at the dataset within the Iris
